# Future Plans

### Publiq

##### Backgrounds PR (in progress)

* Add chance for flipped or rotated images✅, panels, or comics
* Add new backgrounds (as a test)
* Add options to assign ponies to users based on a different seed than their username

##### Next

* LimeChat→input converter
* tagging improvements

##### Font PR (later)

* Fonts for each pony
* Programatic font assignments

##### Later (once I can't think of new features)

* Clean the code (bust up the monolithic functions) 

### Chickens

* Windows release after Backgrounds PR?
