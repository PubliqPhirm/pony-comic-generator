# Future Plans

### Publiq

##### Tag improvements

* More options for tagging
* Tag fonts & bg as well? (or at least set up the plumbing for it)

##### Font PR (later, requires tagging of fonts)

* Fonts for each pony
* Programatic font assignments

##### Code cleanup & unscheduled work

* Clean the code (bust up the monolithic functions) 
* Strip ZNC & MOTD junk with log converter
* Track /nick changes in-comic?

### Chickens

* ~~Windows release after Backgrounds PR?~~
* Boxes for /me commands instead of dialogue bubbles
