# Future Plans

### Publiq

##### Next

* LimeChatâ†’input converter
* tagging improvements
	* More options for tagging
	* Tag fonts & bg as well? (or at least set up the plumbing for it)
	* Support folders for backgrounds
* Actually add all the new backgrounds (I've got a bunch and want to add the folder support so they don't drown out the current pool)

##### Font PR (later)

* Fonts for each pony
* Programatic font assignments

##### Later (once I can't think of new features)

* Clean the code (bust up the monolithic functions) 

### Chickens

* Windows release after Backgrounds PR?
