# Future Plans

### Publiq

##### Tag improvements

* More options for tagging
* Tag fonts & bg as well? (or at least set up the plumbing for it)

##### Font PR (later, requires tagging of fonts)

* Fonts for each pony
* Programatic font assignments

##### Code cleanup (once we can't think of new features)

* Clean the code (bust up the monolithic functions) 

### Chickens

* Windows release after Backgrounds PR?
