#Fonts Folder

* The fonts originally included are left in their current positions in the root `fonts` directory
* New fonts are added into categorised folders, with optional second-level directories for large families
* Don't ask me about the licensing; I think they're mostly from free font archives but we may need to delete a few
* Feel free to delete any that look bad
* I have more where these came from, but I figure that the best fonts for this are either handwritten, digital, or sans-serif

## Directory Descriptions

### Blackface

Extremely heavy fonts with ink that fills most of the available space for each letter.  Should really only be used for decorative purposes (title & random overlays)

### Comic

Fonts in the style of handwriting

### Computer

Fonts that would be good for use by a robotic pony

### Distressed

"Normie" fonts that have been messed up (mostly serif, for some reason)

### Averia

A large font family that was generated by overlaying a huge selection of fonts over one another and averaging the result.  Vanilla Averia looks like a very nice horror movie title script.

### Decorative

Artistic and pretty fonts to use as titles for comics.

### Sans

Normie fonts without serifs

### Serif

Normie fonts with serifs
